/*
A thief trying to escape from a jail has to cross N walls each with varying heights. He climbs X feet every time. But, due to
 the slippery nature of those walls, every times he slips back by Y feet.  Now the task is to calculate the total number of jumps
 required to cross all walls and escape from the jail.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains
three space separated integers X, Y, N. Then in the next line are N space separated values denoting the heights ( Ht[] ) of the walls.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the total number of jumps.
